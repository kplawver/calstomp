== CalStomp

This is a little community calendar built on Rails and MongoMapper.  We're doing this open source-style so SCAD kids (and whoever else wants to) can help us get it done in time for Geekend in November.

== Getting Started

There's not much here, but we'll eventually be using the following:

* MongoDB - If you're on OS X or Linux, just go download it from http://mongodb.org.  If you're on Windows or can't run your own MongoDB instance, go get a free db from http://mongohq.com.  It should work fine for development (and may be what we run this on in production anyway).
* Janrain Engage - http://www.janrain.com/products/engage/get-janrain-engage - Why write and maintain your own Twitter/Facebook/OpenID user stuff when Janrain will do it for you.  
* Amazon S3 - http://amazonaws.com - We'll probably use S3 for storing _something_, most likely user icons (if we don't end up using Gravatar).

I'll be working on user management first, then creating calendar events, activity streams, etc.  If you'd like to help, please add feature requests to the wiki, or start actually writing pieces.  I'll add more documentation as we get farther along.
